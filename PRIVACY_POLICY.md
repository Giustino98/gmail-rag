# Privacy Policy for gmail-rag

**Last Updated:** September 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how your data is handled by the "gmail-rag" Chrome Extension.

### Core Principles
This extension is built with privacy as a priority. Our policy is simple:
*   No data is stored on external servers.
*   Data processing happens locally or through trusted Google services.
*   You are always in control of your data.

### Data Access and Processing
To function, the extension requires read-only access to your Gmail messages via the Google API. 

The content of your emails is **sent only to Google's Gemini API** for processing. As Gemini and Gmail are both Google products, your data is handled within Google's ecosystem according to their own privacy policies. The extension does not send your data to any other third-party service.

### Data Storage
The extension stores the following information **locally in your browser's Chrome storage**:
*   Your Google OAuth access token, which is necessary to communicate with the Gmail API.
*   Your Gemini API key, which you provide to use the AI features.
*   Your extension configuration settings (selected Gmail model, folders preferences).

This information never leaves your computer except when used to authenticate with Google services or make API calls to Gemini.

### Revoking Access
You can revoke the extension's access to your Google Account **at any time** through your Google Account settings page.
